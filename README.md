# Machine-Learning-Potatos_leaf_diaseas_project
The goal of this project is to build an AI-based system that can accurately identify various diseases affecting potato leaves. By analyzing leaf images, the system will classify the leaves into different disease categories, enabling early detection and timely intervention to minimize crop damage.
